# README #

This repository contains a final project consisting of a text-based adventure game based off the popular sitcom "Parks and Recreation". The console game was coded in C++ to apply coursework in class inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation. By no means should this repository be used by other students to copy assignment work.
