#Console-Game: Parks & Recreation Adventure Game

##About
This repository contains a final project consisting of a text-based adventure game based off the popular sitcom "Parks and Recreation". The console game was coded in C++ to apply coursework in class inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation. 

Originally this program used a simple threaded timer to limit game play to no more than 5 minutes. Due to changes in the libraries used which are no longer compatible with the original code, the timer has been removed.

By no means should this repository be used by other students to copy assignment work.
